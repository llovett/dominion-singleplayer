# 
# This file contains definitions for each REACTION card that tell it
# how to act when played. This includes defense cards, and any other
# cards that can have an effect out-of-turn. Each function gets a
# pointer to the current player ('player') and their opponents
# ('opponents') as well as a function that can be applied to the
# player to effect the incoming action (e.g., the action from an
# attack card). Your function can apply this action to 'player' to
# allow the attack card through.
