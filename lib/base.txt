# BASE DECK
# 
# Only supply cards need mention. The usual treasure and victory point
# cards will be added automatically in the game (that is, estate -
# province, copper - gold). Any additional treasure or victory point
# cards need to be specified explicitly. Cards should be listed
# one-per-line. Blank lines and lines beginning with '#' as the first
# character will be ignored.
